* intro
** ai disciplines
*** intelligence
1. natural language processing (i/o)
   communicate in human language
2. knowledge representation
   store/remember sensory input
3. automated reasoning
   answer questions, draw conclusions
4. machine learning
   adapt, extrapolate new patterns
*** physical I/O
1. computer vision
   perceive reality (input)
2. robotics
   manipulate reality (output)

** airplane vs bird
don't think of ai as emulating/modeling humanity
** cognitive science
1. introspection
2. physical observation
3. brain scans
** logic
codifying logic (prolog, etc)
useful in some situations
computationally costly at scale
non-transferable across domains (vision, etc)
- inflexible
** rational agency
agent: do stuff
rational agent: act to achieve best outcome, or best expected outcome (probabilistic)
perfect rationality infeasible in complex settings
- godel's incompleteness
limited rationality: acting w/ incomplete info/processing time
* foundations
** philosophy
Hobbes: mechanical animal
empiricism: understanding via sensory data
induction: relations extablished via observing repeated correlations
logical positivism: empirical induction
- knowledge constructed from logical relations between concepts,
  constructed from sensory input
aristotole: consider means not ends
- your goal is x, how to get to x
- wishful thinking programming
- regression planning system (ai thing)
** mathematics
1. logic
   incompleteness
2. computation
   intractability (polynomial vs exponential)
3. probability
Bayes: *update* probabilities w/ new info
** economics
1. max payoff
2. adversaries (prisoner's dilemma)
3. timescale considerations
utility: preferred outcome
decision theory: macro-econ
- unambiguous
game theory: micro-econ
- sometimes ambiguous
operations: sequential action
- markov decision process
satisficing: "good-enough" decisions
- comparable to human nature
** neuroscience
** psycology
founder: helmholtz (physics guy, optics/vision research)
perception: involves unconscious logical inference
- higher-order features
beliefs/goals ~ pressure/temperature
- emergent qualities of underlying principles
cogition *mental reality model* (Craik)
1. translate sensory input into mental concept model
2. computational concept manipulation w/in mental framework
3. translate outcome/decision into action
** computer engineering
thermodymanic concerns (heat dissapation)
- speed -> parallel (akin to brain)
** control theory & cybernetics
self-regulation, feedback
** linguistics
chomsky: lingual creativity
- create unheard sentences
- formal enough -> programmabl
* history
hebbian learning: update neuronal weights over time
turing's child program
- don't simulate adult mind
- simulate a child's
-- build env for learning
power players: mit, carnigie mellon, stanford
symbolic manipulation: heavy early days
- shown to be lacking since
computational cost of explicit logic representation and manipulation
dendral: mass spec -> chemical identity
- knowledge-based
separate rules from reasoning
neural nets
- connections vs symbols vs logic
embrace diverse influences & scientific method
- neat vs scruffy (lol)
hidden markov model
- mathematical framework
- sequence based, like info theory
- good for nlp
bayesian network
- formalism
- represent and reason w/ uncertainty
- mix classical ai and neural nets
human-level ai (HLAI), artificial general intelligence (AGI)
knowledge bottleneck: hella data better than optimal algorithm
* current capabilities
driving/robots
speech/translation
planning mars missions
chess/go
spam filters
* summary
thinking vs behavior
human vs ideal
rational agent: ideal behavior (in theory)
